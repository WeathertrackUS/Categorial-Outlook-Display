## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use the built-in vulnerability reporting tool in the "Security" tab of the repository. If you are a member of the WTUS Team Ping/ DM a management member.

I will respond as fast as I am able, give me at most a week for a response depending on how busy I am (solo dev team).
